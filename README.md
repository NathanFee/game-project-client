## Planning
I plan to follow the provided schedule setting aside. With exeption of the game engine, I will allow for one day for each component. As I anticipate the game engine itself may be challenging, I allowed for two days its completion. If i complete a component early I will move onto the next. Each component will be further broken down as outlined, focusing on one aspect of the project at a time.

I also plan to use the pomodoro method using a free app called "Be Focused," to avoid burnout.

## User Stories
I tried to create my user stories based on the requirements to ensure I was focused on what was important for the assignment.


1. As a user, I want to be able to sign-up, sign-in and log-out of my own account.
2. As a user, I want all forms to clear after I fill them to protect my information.
3. As a user, I want to be notified all actions, including successful/failed actions.
4. As a user, I want to be able to see when I am logged in.
5. As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
6. As a user, I want to be able to play a game of tic-tac-toe.
7. As a user, I want to see whos turn it currently is.
8. As a user, I want to be able to see if I won, lost or tied my opponent.
9.  As a user, I want to be able to see how many games I've won and lost.
10.  As a user, I want to be able to start a new game.

## Wireframes
I wanted to make my design simple to keep my focus on functionality over appearance. I also prefer a simple clean look.
